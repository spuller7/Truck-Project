Deformation Demo

  This demo shows how to make deformable objects with Truss Physics. Deformable objects can be metal barrels, lampposts, fences, cars and any other objects that should be able plastically deform.

  On the scene:
  - Three cylinder shaped soft bodies are placed one above the other.
  - The Truss asset of the soft bodies is designed to limit the elastic deformation of its links - see Elastic Deformation property in Links tab of Truss Designer. When the deformation exceeds this limit it becomes plastic so it will remain even when the cause of the deformation disappears.
  - When you start the demo the soft bodies fall down on the ground and plastically deform because of the impact and the weight.
